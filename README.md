# Group_project

This is the website application for the Group Software Engineering Project.

The website app uses Django to host the website on a local machine. If Django is
not installed on your computer, follow installation instructions located here:

https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

To start the website application, navigate a terminal into the outer-most mysite folder
then execute the following command.

python manage.py runserver

This should run the website on your machine. We have our settings configured so that
the default address and port for the local host is "127.0.0.1:8000".
From there, as navigation is yet to be configured, so go to "127.0.0.1:8000/game"
to access the riddles.

To manage the riddles stored within the database, as well as permissions of users, navigate
through your browser to "127.0.0.1:8000/admin" and login as your Django superuser.

All members were present during the creation of this WebApp, and all contributed to the
discussion and to the implementation of the ideas.
